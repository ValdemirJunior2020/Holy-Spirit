  - address + contact info
  - quick actions (call / email / maps)

- **Gallery**  
  Simple photo gallery (add images into `client/public/gallery`).

- **Profile Saving (Google Sheets DB)**  
  Saves user profile data (name, email, phone) into a Google Sheet via Google Apps Script Web App.

- **Reviews (Google Sheets DB)**  
  Visitors can submit reviews/testimonies and see latest reviews.

- **Visitor Tracking (Google Sheets DB)**  
  Basic pageview tracking (counts page views + unique-ish visitors using a local visitor id).

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React + Vite + TailwindCSS (rounded, smooth, white/off-white UI)
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express (API + proxy to Apps Script)
- **Database:** Google Sheets via **Google Apps Script Web App**
- **Deploy:** Render (server) + Netlify (client)
